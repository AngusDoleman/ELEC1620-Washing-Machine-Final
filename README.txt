Hello,

This is my final subbmisssion for my washing machine io project for ELEC1620. The aim was to design and implement the control panel of a washing machine using your STM32L476RG Nucleo-64 microcontroller development board. This was developed using Mbed Studio and is my first university coursework submission in year 1.
